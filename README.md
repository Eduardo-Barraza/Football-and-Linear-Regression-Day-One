# Football-and-Linear-Regression-Day-One

Preliminary Program.

Creating a linear regression program to predict a football team's victory based on the number of first downs in a game.

Step-by-step guide on how to approach this project:

### 1. Data Collection
You need to collect data on football games, including the number of first downs and the outcome of the game (win or loss). Here are some sources where you can find this data:

- **NFL Official Website**: The NFL website provides detailed statistics for each game.
- **Sports Data Websites**: Websites like ESPN, Pro Football Reference, and Sports Reference provide extensive statistics on football games.
- **APIs**: You can use sports data APIs such as:
  - [Sportsdata.io](https://sportsdata.io)
  - [Football-API](https://www.football-api.com/)
  - [MySportsFeeds](https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/)

### 2. Data Preparation
Once you have the data, you need to prepare it for analysis. This involves cleaning the data and organizing it into a format suitable for linear regression.

- **Feature Selection**: Your primary feature will be the number of first downs.
- **Target Variable**: Your target variable will be the game outcome (1 for a win, 0 for a loss).

### 3. Implementing Linear Regression
You can use a programming language like Python to implement your linear regression model. Hereâ€™s a basic outline of the process:

#### Step-by-Step Implementation in Python

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
   ```

2. **Load the Data**:
   Assuming you have a CSV file with the data:
   ```python
   data = pd.read_csv('football_data.csv')
   ```

3. **Prepare the Data**:
   ```python
   # Select the relevant columns
   X = data[['First_Downs']]
   y = data['Win']  # Assuming 'Win' is 1 for win and 0 for loss
   ```

4. **Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets**:
   ```python
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   ```

5. **Create and Train the Model**:
   ```python
   model = LogisticRegression()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

6. **Make Predictions**:
   ```python
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

7. **Evaluate the Model**:
   ```python
   accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
   print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
   ```

### 4. Analysis and Improvement
- **Evaluate Model Performance**: Check the accuracy and other metrics to evaluate how well your model is performing.
- **Feature Engineering**: Consider adding more features that could impact the outcome, such as total yardage, turnovers, etc.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust the model's parameters to improve performance.

### Example Data Source
For practice purposes, you can use historical game data available on Kaggle. Here's an example dataset:
- [NFL Game Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/secareanualin/american-football-events) on Kaggle

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you should be able to create a linear regression model to predict a football team's victory based on the number of first downs in a game. The process involves data collection, preparation, model implementation, and evaluation.
